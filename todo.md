# TODO: Voice Message Feature

- [ ] Re-enable and refactor the VoiceRecorder component for consultation form
- Reason for suspension: Hydration errors and excessive time spent debugging a small feature
- Next steps:
  - Investigate hydration mismatch root cause (likely external or library issue)
  - Ensure robust, simple, and accessible voice recording UX
  - Add comprehensive tests for SSR/CSR compatibility
  - Only re-enable when stable and user-friendly

**Temporarily removed from FloatingConsultationCTA as of [today's date].**
