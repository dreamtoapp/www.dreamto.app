# Folder Structure Rule

- UI components go in `components/`
- Server actions/business logic go in `actions/`
- Utility functions/hooks go in `helpers/`
- If any of these folders do not exist, create them and add a `README.md` explaining what goes inside.
- If the folder exists, make sure each file is in the correct subfolder.
- This keeps the project organized and easy to understand for everyone!

Example structure:
- [components/](mdc:components/README.md)
- [actions/](mdc:app/(e-comm)/actions/README.md)
- [helpers/](mdc:app/(e-comm)/helpers/README.md)
